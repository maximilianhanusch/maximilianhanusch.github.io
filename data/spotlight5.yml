    <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
    <p>My teaching philosophy is grounded in the experiences I gained during my own studies. I believe that cultivating curiosity is not just about answering questions but also about inspiring others to ask them, just as I was inspired to stay curious by my mentors. Be it at field trips, lab sessions, or theoretical discussions â€”  the aim is to transform the learning environment into an ecosystem in which curiosity thrives.
